# waveslim

The R packages **waveslim** contains basic wavelet routines for time series (1D), image (2D) and array (3D) analysis. The code provided here is based on wavelet methodology developed in Percival and Walden (2000); Gencay, Selcuk and Whitcher (2001); the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (CWT) from Kingsbury (1999, 2001) as implemented by Selesnick; and Hilbert wavelet pairs (Selesnick 2001, 2002). All figures in chapters 4-7 of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0122796705/">Gencay, Selcuk and Whitcher (2001)</a> are reproducible using this package and R code available at the <a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~bwhitche/book/">book's website</a>.
